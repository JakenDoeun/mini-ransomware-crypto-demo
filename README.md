# safe-ransomware-crypto-demo

## Introduction
Ransomware has become one of the most damaging kinds of cyber threats, which involved individual, companies, and even governments in the last years. The point that make ransomware so powerful is the practice of modern cryptography to lock data in a way that is nearly impossible to reverse without the correct key. all of these, become the reason that cybersecurity students and blue-team defenders must clearly understand how cryptographic algorithms used inside ransomware attacks.

This project will explore into the cryptographic method most commonly found within ransomware attacks in a secure and controlled environment meaning instead of creating malicious software, it demonstrates how encryption work with small test files or dump data. The focus lies on the hybrid encryption model, where symmetric algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), are used to encrypt the actual data while asymmetric algorithms, such as RSA, encrypt the AES key. This allows an attacker to quickly encrypt large amounts of data and still securely protect its key.

The project also discusses other related cryptographic concepts such as key generation, entropy and randomness, hashing for integrity, and why brute-forcing modern encryption is not realistic. Understanding these concepts allows students to explain better how ransomware manages to lock data so effectively and why victims cannot simply “break” the encryption.

The motivation behind this project is to help defenders understand the technical side of ransomware and this will  help us to have better detect malicious behavior, design preventive measures, and educate users or organizations about the risks. People often know that ransomware are "encrypts files", but very few understand what happens beneath it. This project fills this gap by providing a clear, practical demonstration with real cryptographic principles.

Overall, this project explores how cryptography is used in ransomware, provides a safe demonstration of the encryption process, and highlight the importance of strong cybersecurity practices to protect against this type of attacks.
